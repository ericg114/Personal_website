				<h2>About Me</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I am Eric Gonzalez, an incoming student at Baruch College. I am a hard-working and dedicated student with a passion for learning. I am also a creative and innovative thinker with a strong interest in problem-solving.

				In high school I took a rigorous course load and earned high grades. I was also involved in a variety of extracurricular activities, including the Science Olympiad, and the student government.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Passions and Interests</h3>
				<p>I am passionate about coding, gaming, and reading. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems, the sense of accomplishment, and the joy that these activities provide. I am always looking for new challenges. I am confident that I will continue to pursue my passions in these areas.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Goals and Aspirations</h3>
				<p>I am also passionate about using my coding skills to create educational tools that can help people learn about finance. I believe that everyone should have access to financial education, and I want to use my skills to make that happen. I hope to create tools that are engaging and interactive, and that can help people learn about finance in a fun and meaningful way. Ultimately, I want to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world of finance and help people achieve their financial goals.</p>

			<section>
				<h3>Values and Beliefs</h3>
				<p>I believe that it is important to give back to the community and help others in need. I believe that we all have a responsibility to help those who are less fortunate than us. There are many ways to give back to the community, such as volunteering your time, donating to charity, or simply being kind to others. I believe that even small acts of kindness can make a big difference in the world.</p><br>

					<p>I believe that we are all connected and that we have a responsibility to each other. I believe that we are all part of a larger community, and that we have a responsibility to help each other. We are all connected, whether we like it or not. Our actions affect others, and their actions affect us. I believe that we have a responsibility to use our power to help others and make the world a better place.</p>
